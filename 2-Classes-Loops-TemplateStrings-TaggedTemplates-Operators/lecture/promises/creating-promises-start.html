  // Promise constructor takes a function as an argument of the variable resolve and reject 
  // Your promise will either resolve (succed) or reject(error) 


      // make sure to pass the Error object so that you can actually find the correct line of the error message 


  // because we do not parse out the data as json - it gets passed as a response instead
