  // you may also use the spread operator to select all tags as '.people p' is a nodelist 
  // const people = [...document.querySelectorAll('people p')];



  // here we can use the spread operator to spread the ingredients within the deepDish object 


  // Here we want to delete a given mean comment 


  // we first have to find the index of a given comment 


  
  // then we have to create a new list without the comment that was deleted 
  // Here we will slice(add) everthing up to the mean comment, then also slice everything after the mean comment 
  // we dont have to pass a second variable to the second slice as it will go to the end
