  // A spread operator takes every single item from an iterable and adds it to a given list, object, etc. 
  // An iterable is anything you can loop through with a for-of loop and that includes arrays, strings, DOM nodes, argument objects, maps, and sets 
  const featured = ['Deep Dish', 'Pepperoni', 'Hawaiian'];
  const specialty = ['Meatzza', 'Spicy Mama', 'Margherita'];

  // This also acceptable if you are simply adding together two different iterables 


  // this is how you easily copy an array - we use the spread operator to copy each element 


  // sample string spread
