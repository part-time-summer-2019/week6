  // .from() and .of() are methods on the Array itself and not the prototype, so we have to treat them differently than .map() or .filter()  
  // .from() will convert an array-ish(nodelist in this example) object into an actual array 
  // '.people p' selects all the 'p's within the div class "people"


  // we intentionally draw an error here and show that .map() does not work on the nodelist of people 

  
  // in order to make array methods work, we need to convert the nodelist into an array 
  // we take the persons within the people nodelist and return the person.textContent using the Array.from() method 

  
  // now lets try to handle an array with an indeterminant amount of elements 

    // we need to first convert arguments into an actual array before we can perform the reduce method  


    // reduce() executes a reducer function (that you provide) on each member of the array resulting in a single output value
    // in our case, our function add the previous value with the next value 


  
  // .of() creates an array of however many arguments you pass to it.
