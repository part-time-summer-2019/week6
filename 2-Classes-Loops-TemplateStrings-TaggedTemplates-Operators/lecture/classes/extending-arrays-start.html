  // ONLY START THIS LECTURE ONCE YOU HAVE GONE THROUGH REST AND SPREAD OPERATORS 
  // Here we are going to create our own classes off a given array   
  // like before we need a constructor that takes in the name of the move and a rest operator to take in the rest of the movies 
  // You must always FIRST create the variable you are extending `super(...items)`before you start defining other variables within a given class 


    // we can then also add additional methods to the class 


    // we set a limit to the number of stars
    // then this.sort is the movies within the collection
