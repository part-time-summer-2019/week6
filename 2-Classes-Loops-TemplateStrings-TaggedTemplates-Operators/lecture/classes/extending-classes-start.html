  // ES classes may also be extended to other classes 
  // as a rule of thumb - don't extend beyond 2 levels   



  // Here we extend the Class of Animal and create a more specific class of Dog 
  // we still need the constructor to include the additional variables


      // instead of this.name, you need to use super(name) in order to inherit the properties 
      // from the class it is currently extending from   


    // we then also add additional methods on the extend class
