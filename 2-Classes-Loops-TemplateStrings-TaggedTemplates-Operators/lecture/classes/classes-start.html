  // Here is how we create a class of a given Dog 
  // the only method that is absolutely needed is 'constructor'
  // which is the method that allows you to instantiate a class 

    // Whenever you have a method within a class - you can simply add it 

    // this is a static method - which can only be called on the class Dog directly 
    // Dog.info() - not snickers.info()

    // this is a getter - it is accessed by snickers.description
    // this is not a method - it is just a property you can put on the class 

    // this is a setter to set a value on a given object 

    // and here we can now get the nickname of a given dog
