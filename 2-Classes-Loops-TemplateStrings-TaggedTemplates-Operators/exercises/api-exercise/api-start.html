        // You will need to use most of the following lessons you have learned in order to accomplish this task 
        // Use querySelector or getElementById to get the input value and display the results

        
        // create a function which uses a promise to to reach out to the IEX API 
        // use the following link as your endpoint - https://api.iextrading.com/1.0/stock/[TICKER]/quote
        // make sure to preventDefault so that the console doesn't keep re-rendering 
        // make sure to either resolve or reject the promise
        // also make sure to parse out the data correctly - hint - JSON format 

        
        // Now you need to create a function which will allow you to show the following data
        // closing price, sector, 52 week high, 52 week low, difference in high and low 
        // You will also need to use the innerHTML method to render the information 


        // Make sure to add an event listener to make this all work out
