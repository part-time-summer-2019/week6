    // Lets start by first seeing what a default function looks like
    // here we set default values for tax and tip which can then be overridden 
    function calculateBill(total, tax = 0.13, tip=0.15) {
        return total + (total*tax) + (total*tip);
    }

    const totalBill = calculateBill(100, undefined, 0.25);
    console.log('The total bill is: ', totalBill)


    // Now lets look at arrow functions with some built-in JS methods 
    const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

    // Now console.log the ages which are greater than 62 - we will use the method .filter() which creates a new array from an existing one 
    // this basically means that if age is greater than 60, then add it to the old array 
    const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
    console.log('The ages above 60 are: ',old);


    // Now lets touch on the topic of template strings - we will dive deeper into this topic over the next few days 
    const names = ['Jim', 'Pam', 'Dwight', 'Michael'];

    //`${name}` - back ticks are used for template strings

    // Now we are going to find different ways to console.log a full names list using the built-in JS method .map()
    const fullNames = names.map( function(name) {
        return `${name} OFFICE LIFER`
    })
    console.log('Full Names', fullNames);


    // you can drop the word "function" and add a fat arrow in replacement
    const fullNames2 = names.map((name) => {
        return `${name} OFFICE LIFER`;
    });
    console.log('Full Names 2', fullNames2)


    // If you only have one parameter, a parenthesis is not needed
    const fullNames3 = names.map(name => {
        return `${name} OFFICE LIFER`;
    });
    console.log('Full Names 3', fullNames3)


    // This is an implicit return - you need to delete the curly brackets 
    const fullNames4 = names.map(name => `${name} OFFICE LIFER`);
    console.log('Full Names 4', fullNames4)

    // This is an example if you have no arguments at all - an Annonymous Function 
    const fullNames5 = names.map(() => `OFFICE LIFER`);
    console.log(fullNames5)

    // this is how you name functions, the last 4 functions do not have names and thus cannot be called upon
    const sayMyName = (name) => {
        alert(`Hello ${name}!`)
    }

    sayMyName('GABBBBBBBBY')

    // Now let's implicitly return 3 values from 2 variables 
    const race = '100m Dash';
    const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

    // Parenthesis signal an implicit return so that something will be returned whenever the const win is called 
    // you don't have to use the syntax "race:race". If you input race and it wil be given a key name matching the value '100m Dash'
    // map treats 'i' as the index position of a given array 
    const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

    console.table(win)
