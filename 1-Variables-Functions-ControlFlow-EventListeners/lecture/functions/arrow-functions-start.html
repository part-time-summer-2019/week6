    // Lets start by first seeing what a default function looks like
    // here we set default values for tax and tip which can then be overridden 


    // Now lets look at arrow functions with some built-in JS methods 
    const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];

    // Now console.log the ages which are greater than 62 - we will use the method .filter() which creates a new array from an existing one 
    // this basically means that if age is greater than 60, then add it to the old array 



    // Now lets touch on the topic of template strings - we will dive deeper into this topic over the next few days 
    const names = ['Jim', 'Pam', 'Dwight', 'Michael'];

    //`${name}` - back ticks are used for template strings
    // Now we are going to find different ways to console.log a full names list using the built-in JS method .map()



    // you can drop the word "function" and add a fat arrow in replacement



    // If you only have one parameter, a parenthesis is not needed



    // This is an implicit return - you need to delete the curly brackets 


    // This is an example if you have no arguments at all - an Annonymous Function 


    // this is how you name functions, the last 4 functions do not have names and thus cannot be called upon


    // Now let's implicitly return 3 values from 2 variables 


    // Parenthesis signal an implicit return so that something will be returned whenever the const win is called 
    // you don't have to use the syntax "race:race". If you input race and it wil be given a key name matching the value '100m Dash'
    // map treats 'i' as the index position of a given array
