// Let's start by learning the difference between "let" and "const" 
// "let" is a mutable variable, while "const" is a immutable variable 
let number = 10;
console.log(number)

number = 20;
console.log(number)

const name = 'Gabby';
console.log(name)

// here if we attempt to change the variable, we will see that we run into an error 
// name = 'Larry'
// console.log(name)

const person = {
    name: 'Eric Cartman',
    age: 13,
    food: 'Cheesy Poofs'
}

console.log(person)
console.log(person.age)

// Whenver objects are saved as const variables - this actually does not create an immutable variable 
person.age = 20;
console.log('age after changing the object',person)

// So in order to freeze an object, we need to do the following
const frozen_person = Object.freeze(person);

console.log('frozen person', frozen_person)

frozen_person.age = 33;

console.log('As we can see, the details of the frozen person does not changes',frozen_person)

// This is what we call the temporal dead zone - always define your variables before calling them within a given method 
console.log(pizza)
const pizza = 'Deep Dish üçïüçïüçï';
