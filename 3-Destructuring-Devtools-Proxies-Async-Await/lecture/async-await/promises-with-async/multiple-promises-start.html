      // Wait for both of them to come back
      // here we can put an await around both of the api endpoints
      // Promise.all takes an array of promises - this creates a mega promise which doesn't resolve until both promises have been resolved 

      // again we have to parse each of the responses as json 

      // here we destructure the array then await again the parsing of the json data 



    // This operates the same way as the function above, except that take in the array of names
    // instead of defining each enpoint, we are going to use a base URL which we will loop over for each username 


      // we can create as the response if don't know the number of usernames we want to pass
