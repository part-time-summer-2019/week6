    // This is the non-Promise way of dealing with a callback based function
    // this will get us our current GPS position
    // it takes two arguments 1) the success function 2) the error function 


    // Here we will Promisify the callback function 
    // Here we will pass resolve and reject like normal and also pass a rest operators for the args.
    // ...args can be variables such as accuracy of position depending upon battery life 



    // we then need to create an async function because we cannot await for things out in the open
