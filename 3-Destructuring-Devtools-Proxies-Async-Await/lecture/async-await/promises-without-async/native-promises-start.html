    // Here is the standard fetch ajax request which will allow you make a simple Native Promise 
    // using then and catch 



   
    // this is how you access the webcam on someone's computer 
    // getUserMedia also returns a promise which we can resolve or reject 


      // here we will set the sourceObject equal to the mediaStream and set it into the video element 
      // we then load and play the video
