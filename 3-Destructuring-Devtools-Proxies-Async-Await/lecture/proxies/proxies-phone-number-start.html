  // Here we will create a phoneHandler to handle the set and get traps 
  // set takes in the variables (target, name, value) while get just takes (target, name) 
  // Here we will use the proxy to reformat phone numbers consistently 


      // Here we will run a match on just the numbers and join them   

    // Then once we pull the object out of the inputted format, we then replace regex to format it in the standard phone number fashion 

  // Here we are passing a blank object so that we can set whatever we decide to input (ex: phoneNumbers.home)
