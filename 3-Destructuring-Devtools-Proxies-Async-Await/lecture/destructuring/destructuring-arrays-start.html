  // when you destructure an array you have to use '[]', objects will require '{}'
  // Here we don't have to use the index position of a given detail 

  // gabby,tan,cool will not be destructured because there are more values than variables 
  // this allows use to split the string into different variables split by a ',' 


  const team = ['Kenso', 'Carter', 'Greg', 'Gabby', 'Devarsh'];
  
  // this is rest operator that spreads the entire team as players, and sets the first and second element as captain and assistant respectively 

  // players becomes an array of whatever is left
