   // Destructuring is the process of extracting data from arrays, object, and maps, and sets into their own variables


  // this is how we destructure an object. It is the equivalent of writing:
  // const first = person.first; const last = person.last; const twitter = person.twitter


  
  // This is a nested object which takes a little more to destructure 



  // when data is nested, then you have to add the values of a given key to get to the last nested value 



  // height, fontSize
  // the destructuring will take the values from settings, but will then fall to the default values otherwise
