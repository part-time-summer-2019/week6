  // Here we will select all the holes and the score board  
  const holes = document.querySelectorAll('.hole');
  const scoreBoard = document.querySelector('.score');
  const moles = document.querySelectorAll('.mole');
  // Here we will create a variable called lastHole our randomHole function 


  // Here we will create a variable called timeUp to set the length of the game - we will us this in the peep and startGame functions


  // Here let's create a variable for score and set the default to 0 - we will use this in startGame and bonk functions




  // We first need to create a function that gives us a random time between a min and a max value
  // Think of this as a utitlity function 



  // Now we have to select a random hole for the mole to pop up from 
  // This function will take a list of wholes which we query selected
  // We have to create a function which gives us a random index value for the number of holes we have 
  // we want to make sure that the mole doesn't pop up in the same hole twice 




      // Here we will add a check to see if the new hole is equal to the last hole
      // if it is equal to the last hole, then run the function again, otherwise set lastHole to hole and return it
      // this is a recursive function 


  // Next we now have to get the moles to pop up 
  // First we get a randomTime and randomHole to select which mole pops up for how long 


      // we will now add the class 'up' to the hole and remove the class once the time is up 

          // Here we will keep running peep until the game time is up 


  // Now we have to create the startGame function 
  // We have to reset the scoreBoard, set timeUp to false, set score to 0, initiate peep, and setTimeout for timeUp 


  // Finally we have to create a function for bonking the moles on the head



    // Here we will add a check so that JS functions used to simulate clicks are not present


    // Here have to remove the 'up' class whenever the mole is bonked
    // we have to use this.parentNode in order to remove the class of 'up' for the mole bonked


  // We need to create an eventListener here for when we 'click' on the moles
