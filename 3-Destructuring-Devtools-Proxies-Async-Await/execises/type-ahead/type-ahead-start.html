const endpoint = 'https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Miserlou/c5cd8364bf9b2420bb29/raw/2bf258763cdddd704f8ffd3ea9a3e81d25e2c6f6/cities.json';

// endpoint is an array with a json file which we need to parse in to a workable format
// For starter code, the API has already been fetched and pushed to the cities array
const cities = [];
fetch(endpoint)
  .then(blob => blob.json())
  // we push the data here because we don't want the const cities to change later
  // ... is a spread which allows you to properly divide the array of cities,
  // and not create a list of list
  .then(data => cities.push(...data));

// check and see what the data looks like! 
console.log(cities);

// Create a function which filters down the array of cities based on your search input 
// in order to make the search case insensitive, you will need to use Regex code
// 'g' is global - looks through entire string, 'i'means case insensitive
// const regex = new RegExp(wordToMatch, 'gi');
// as you 'filter' through the list, match the elements with you input 
// you will need to use match(regex) in order to match both the city AND state 


// Here is a function that adds commas to a given number - use for the population
function numberWithCommas(x) {
  return x.toString().replace(/\B(?=(\d{3})+(?!\d))/g, ',');
}



// Now we need to create the display function to display matches within the suggestions container
// remember that you can use this.value to get certain inputs from the search bar
// again you will use the following RegExp code for your search 
// const regex = new RegExp(this.value, 'gi');
// I'd like for your to highlight the character you have typed in the search bar 
// you will need to use the built-in JS method replace()
// When returning the innerHTML make sure to use join() for aesthetic purposes 



// Create your querySelectors for both the search and the suggestions containers


//We now need to add EventListeners to trigger the query and run the displayMatch function
// The events you will be looking for are 'change' and 'keyup'
// 'change' occurs whenever the input text is changed and a click occurs off the search bar
// 'keyup' occurs whenever keys are changed in the search bar
